# Angular-Validators

numberonly.directive is a directive meant to restrict what a user can enter into an input. There is the option of type="number"
but that doesn't work in IE(perhaps other browers too). The directive has some options to allow '.' and '-',
but in it's base form only allows number inputs.

name-validator is an async validator made for angular reactive form.
